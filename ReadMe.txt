Remote Dekstop Viewer, similiar to VNC.<br/>
This is my own creation of a VNC-Like application written in c++. <br/>
<br/>
I originally wrote this in c#, but the performance was pretty bad and unreliable. So, I am rewriting it in c++.
For the c# version you can check my other projects. It is a stable project, but does not deliver the performance that I needed.
<br/>
the difference in performance so far is staggering with the c++ version of the server running about 4-10X as fast and the veiwer even moreso.
